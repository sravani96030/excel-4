WHAT IS BENIFT OF MICROSOFT 365?
ANS:- Office 365 allows your organisation to store all the files in the cloud. This

Q.NO:-2 USE TWO DATASETS AND PERFORM JOIN ON SPECIFIC 
COLUMNS.
ANS:- In you want to join on multiple columns instead of a single column, then you 
can pass a list of column names to Dataframe. merge() instead of single column name. 
Also, as we didn't specified the value of 'how' argument, therefore by default Dataframe. 
merge() uses inner join.
If you'd like to get data stored in tables joined by a compound key that's a primary 
key in one table and a foreign key in another table, simply use a join condition on 
multiple columns. In one joined table (in our example, enrollment ), we have a 
primary key built from two columns ( student_id and course_code ).

name! When everything is entered, you will see who underpaid and who overpaid in the row 
labeled “Total Debt/Income”.
